            /* Operating System Basics
             
            An operating system (OS) is software that manages hardware resources and 
            provides services to other software (applications). It's made up of different layers:

            1. User Space (Applicatin Layer)
            This is the layer where user applications run. 
            Programs like browsers, editors, etc., operate in this space.

            Applications in the application layer make requests to the OS 
            through system calls to interact with hardware (e.g., file reading, memory allocation).

            2. Kernel Space
            The kernel is the core part of the OS and operates at a low level, 
            directly interacting with the hardware.
            
            The kernel manages crucial tasks like memory, CPU scheduling, and device communication.
            It's responsible for resource management (CPU, memory, disk, I/O devices) and 
            ensures applications use hardware without conflicting.

            3. Hardware
            This includes all physical devices, like the CPU, RAM, storage, network interfaces, and peripherals.
            In simple terms, applications can't access hardware directly. 
            They request services (like writing to disk or sending data) from the kernel, which controls the hardware.
