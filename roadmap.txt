         C# Learning Path
====================================
This document outlines a comprehensive learning path for C# programming and related technologies. 
The topics are categorized into five main sections: 

1. Core Programming, 
2. API Development, 
3. Testing and Debugging, 
4. Data and SQL Management, 
5. Advanced Topics and Tools.
