         C# Learning Path
====================================
This document outlines a comprehensive learning path for C# programming and related technologies. 
The topics are categorized into five main sections: 

1. Core Programming, 
2. API Development, 
3. Testing and Debugging, 
4. Data and SQL Management, 
5. Advanced Topics and Tools. 

Each section includes essential subtopics that are crucial for building expertise in C# and .NET development.
